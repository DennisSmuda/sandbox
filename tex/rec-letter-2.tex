Here is a draft template for  \LaTeX\ which attempts to emulate the new University regulations.  There are a number of features which are not ``exactly'' correct. 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Helvetica has been used throughout 
\item 10 point for all text  
\item  The date will always appear some distance from the address, rather than a fixed distance from the top of the page (though this can be manually adjusted in case that  
an envelope window is used) 
\end{itemize}
Note:
{\bf 

Please do not print the colour version on a black-and-white printer!! 

You should not edit the style file (leedsletter.sty) or logo files. }
